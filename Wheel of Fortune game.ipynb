    "## Rules of our game:\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are human players and computer players.\n",
    "    - Every player has some amount of money (\\$0 at the start of the game)\n",
    "    - Every player has a set of prizes (none at the start of the game) \n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "- The goal is to guess a phrase within a category. For example:\n",
    "    - Category: CEO and Company\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Phrase: Elon Musk - Tesla\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "- Players see the category and an obscured version of the phrase where every alphanumeric character in the phrase starts out as hidden (using underscores: _):\n",
    "    - Category: CEO and Company\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Phrase: ____ ____ - _______\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "- Note that case (capitalization) does not matter\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "- During their turn, every player spins the wheel to determine a prize amount and:\n",
    "    - If the wheel lands on a cash square, players may do one of three actions:\n",
    "        - Guess any letter that hasn’t been guessed by typing a letter (a-z)\n",
    "            - Vowels (a, e, i, o, u) cost \\$250 to guess and can’t be guessed if the player doesn’t have enough money. All other letters are “free” to guess\n",
    "\n",
    "            - The player can guess any letter that hasn’t been guessed and gets that cash amount for every time that letter appears in the phrase\n",
    "\n",
    "        - If there is a prize, the user also gets that prize (in addition to any prizes they already had)\n",
    "\n",
    "        - If the letter does appear in the phrase, the user keeps their turn. Otherwise, it’s the next player’s turn\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Example: The user lands on \\$500 and guesses ‘E’\n",
    "            - There are two E’s in the phrase, so the player wins \\$1000\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Guess the complete phrase by typing a phrase (anything over one character that isn’t ‘pass’)\n",
    "        - If they are correct, they win the game\n",
    "\n",
    "        - If they are incorrect, it is the next player’s turn\n",
    "           #### Note: Enter the complete phrase if you are confident or just a single letter\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "    - Pass their turn by entering 'pass'\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "    - If the wheel lands on “lose a turn”, the player loses their turn and the game moves on to the next player\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "    - If the wheel lands on “bankrupt”, the player loses their turn and loses their money but they keep all of the prizes they have won so far.\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "- The game continues until the entire phrase is revealed (or one player guesses the complete phrase)\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "- type 'exit' to close the game\n",
    "---    \n",
    "## Customization \n",
    "- Currently the game has only 3 categories\n",
    "    - \"CEO and Company\"\n",
    "    - \"Company and Headquarter Location\"\n",
    "    - \"Top 10 Fortune 500 companies in US\"\n",
    " - Feel free to add more categories in the text file name- 'phrases.txt'\n",
    " - (Similarly, you can add your own prizes and cash to the file 'wheel.txt')\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can also increase the difficult of the game adding more rules and make changes accordingly to the code.\n",
    "---\n",
    "## Credit\n",
    "- This game is a part of final course project of University of Michigan course- Python Classes and Inheritance on Coursera.\n",
    "- An excellent course to brush up all the OOPS concepts\n",
